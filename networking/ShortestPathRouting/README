#------------------------------------- Overview -------------------------------------#

Implementation of a shortest path routing algorithm used between virual routers on
a virtual network. Routers contact central authority for its neighbours (nse) and 
associated cost to send packet to that neighbour.  It introduces itself to its 
neighbours using HELLO packets. Once neighbours know of eachother, they will send over
their respective neighbours using LSPDU packets. The shortest path algorithm will run
on the corresponding network topology discovered (only considers routers within 2 hops
of source router).

#----------------------------------- Compilation ------------------------------------#

Python files were compiled using Python 2.7.12

#------------------------------------- Testing --------------------------------------#

Testing was done on the following servers respectively

emulator: ubuntu1604-006
router:   ubuntu1604-004

#----------------------------------- Parameters -------------------------------------#

Router program:
<router id>
<host address of network emulator>
<port of the network emulator>
<open port on router>

Emulator program:
<host address that routers are on>
<open port on emulator>

#----------------------------------- Example Usage -----------------------------------#

On host hostX:
        ./nse-linux386 hostY 9999

On host hostY:
        python router 1 hostX 9999 9991
        python router 2 hostX 9999 9992 
        python router 3 hostX 9999 9993 
        python router 4 hostX 9999 9994 
        python router 5 hostX 9999 9995
