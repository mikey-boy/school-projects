#------------------------------------- Overview -------------------------------------#

A simple "go back n" protocal to ensure a reliable data transfer over an unreliable
transfer medium (in this case UDP). It works by send packets from send to reciever 
through a provided emulater that will drop certain packet and add delays to other.
It is solely used to send text-based files 

#----------------------------------- Compilation ------------------------------------#

Python files were compiled using Python 2.7.12

#------------------------------------- Testing --------------------------------------#

Testing was done on the following servers respectively

emulator: ubuntu1604-002
sender:   ubuntu1604-004
receiver: ubuntu1604-006

#----------------------------------- Parameters -------------------------------------#

# Parameters showed in order of appearance

Sender program:

<host address of the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the emulator to receive data from the sender>
<UDP port number used by the sender to receive ACKs from the emulator>
<name of the file to be transferred>

Receiver program:

<hostname for the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the link emulator to receive ACKs from the receiver>
<UDP port number used by the receiver  to  receive  data  from  the  emulator>
<name  of  the  file  into  which  the received data is written>

Emulator:

<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction>
<receiver’s network address>
<receiver’s receiving UDP port number>
<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction>
<sender’s network address>
<sender’s receiving UDP port number>
<maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond>
<packet discard probability>
<verbose-mode>
